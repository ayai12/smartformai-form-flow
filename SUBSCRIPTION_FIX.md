## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still experiencing issues:

2. Verify that the webhook is properly configured in Stripe
3. Check Firebase Functions logs for any errors
4. Ensure your Firestore security rules allow writing subscription data
5. Try clearing browser cache and cookies
6. Verify that the user ID is correctly passed to the subscription functions

## Testing the Fix

1. Create a new subscription through the checkout process
2. Check the browser console for "Subscription data" logs

4. Test cancellation and renewal flows

## Manual Data Fix (if needed)

If a user's subscription data is still missing, you can manually add it to Firestore:

1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore
2. Find the user document (users/{userId})
3. Add a subscription object with the following fields:
   - planId: "starter" or "pro"
   - billingCycle: "monthly" or "annual"
   - status: "active"
   - productName: "Starter Plan" or "Pro Plan"
   - amount: 9 or 29 (or annual amount)
   - interval: "month" or "year"
   - currentPeriodEnd: (timestamp for 1 month/year from now)
   - features: (copy from PRODUCTS object in functions/index.js)
