### Overview
Every survey includes a dedicated analytics page powered by the **Analytics Insight Engine** — an intelligent six-step AI system that reads your results like a data expert, explains what’s happening, and recommends exactly what to do next.

### 🧩 The 6-Step Analytics Insight Engine

#### 1️⃣ Trend Detection
Finds hidden data patterns and anomalies:
- “90% of users skipped Question 4.”
- “Completion rate dropped 20% this week.”
- “Mobile users complete faster than desktop.”
- “Most responses came from the UK in the last 24 hours.”

#### 2️⃣ Performance Scoring
Gives every question a live “engagement score” (0–100):
- High score → keep or highlight  
- Low score → suggest rewording or replacement  

Example:  
> “Question 4 has a low engagement score (12/100). It might be too complex or irrelevant.”

#### 3️⃣ Behavioral Insights
Understands user intent and emotional tone from text answers:
- “Users love the design but find pricing confusing.”
- “Sentiment is neutral, with mentions of ‘slow loading’.”

#### 4️⃣ Conversion & UX Signals
Finds what impacts engagement and drop-offs:
- “Drop-off rate is highest on page 2.”
- “Shorter surveys lead to 3x more completions.”

#### 5️⃣ AI Recommendations
Turns insights into clear, human advice:  
> “Simplify or remove Question 4. Merge it with Question 3 — they cover similar topics.  
> Shortening the survey may improve completion rate by ~15%.”

#### 6️⃣ Continuous Learning
Your Agent gets smarter with every response — refining questions, improving flow, and learning what works best.
